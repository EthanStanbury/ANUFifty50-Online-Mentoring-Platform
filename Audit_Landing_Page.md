# ONLINE MENTORING PROGRAM PLATFORM

## CLIENT - ANU FIFTY50

Our client ANU Fifty50 is a student-run organisation promoting gender equity in STEM. Their vision is to have an equitable STEM pipeline from university to industry and academia, inclusive of all students, regardless of their gender.

The project is to build an Online Mentoring Platform in the form of a website. The intent is to replace the current Wattle platform used by Fifty50. The platform automates the current mentoring program. Younger students (mentees) are paired with older students (mentors), which leads to the formation of inter-year networks. The program is different from other mentoring programs around as it has targeted content and forces the users to be reflective. Users can sign up to the platform anytime. Once there is a match, a mentoring relationship is started. Content is released fortnightly and mentees and mentors can meet each other either in person or online.

## PROJECT AUDIT REQUIREMENTS
### VALUE DELIVERED TO OUR CLIENT SINCE THE LAST PROJECT AUDIT
Since the last project audit in Week 6, the team has progressed towards delivering the project requirements. The requirements document can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qKgYfd_GCYSdkY3e44BlUMY-dMn5Dcj8wFL-oyatUzU 

* The platform can now match mentees and mentors so that mentors can have multiple mentees. Completing the pairing feature means that the client is now able to provide the mentoring service through the platform.
* Admins can now upload weekly/fortnightly content to mentors and mentees based on gender equity topics and general university support. 
* Admins can now edit the digest page, which contains a summary of that particular fortnight’s theme.
* Admins can now post news and events through a Django App called Blog. This lets them enter a title, a description and a picture, which can be posted to mentees and mentors. 
* Fifty50’s social media feeds such as Facebook and Twitter have been added to the digest page and the news and events page.
* A settings page has been created so that users can update their profile details at any time. 
* The feedback form has now been moved to the profile page so that users can give feedback to admins every week or fortnight. 
* The team has fixed frontend issues including JavaScript errors. 
* The site has been made mobile compatible by adding more styling to the mobile version. 
* The team has completed the project poster, which was displayed at the showcase in Week 10. A PDF version of the poster can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw7MUyh12MoYVDNnWVN6cXgzTkk 
* The site has been deployed now. The link is http://fifty50mentoring.pythonanywhere.com/ 

### EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE DECISION MAKING
After the Week 3 audit, we created a decision paper document, which encompasses all the decisions that have been made since Week 1 of Semester 2. This was highlighted in the Week 6 Audit. Since then, this document has been updated and contains the decisions made by the team organised by weeks in which they were made. It indicates what decisions were made, when they were made and why they were made. The decision log can be found here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XtujnVUvyAoELIFgfqHR2vYqOldP2CBT82ymI5FR2tA">Decision Paper</a>

## PROJECT GOVERNANCE
### EVIDENCE OF DECISION MAKING
Evidence of all decisions since week 1 can be found in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XtujnVUvyAoELIFgfqHR2vYqOldP2CBT82ymI5FR2tA/edit?usp=sharing">Decision Paper</a>

### ORGANISATION OF THE PROJECT
As you can see at the top of our page, each team member has a specific role. Each role is either relevant to working on the front-end of our website or the back-end of our website. Each person has assigned tasks which can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/Nikita1710/ANUFifty50-Online-Mentoring-Platform/issues">GitHub Issues Log</a>. In addition tasks which are deemed "administrative" are logged on our <a href="https://trello.com/b/l25xR0T2/timeline-semester-2">Trello Board</a> to keep track week by week. This means all assessment related items and goals for the week are logged on that board.

### TRACEABILITY OF ACTIONS
Every task that is created has a trace of who has worked on it. When committing our code, we add “#<Issue Number>” to our commit message so that GitHub can recognise it and add it to the respective issue. Each action that is performed on an issue, like adding it to a milestone, changing assignees or closing or opening the issue is logged by GitHub. You can find our github issue log here: <a href="https://github.com/Nikita1710/ANUFifty50-Online-Mentoring-Platform/issues">GitHub Issues Log</a>


## PROJECT OUTPUTS
### TECHNICAL DEPTH OF OUTPUTS
One of the main issues we have been having in the past few weeks was due to pairing as an admin couldn't easily see which mentor was paired to a mentee. For this we had to look back into our model of how we instatiated our mentees and mentors. We were then able to link this to the pairing application within Django so that an admin can now see which user is a mentor or mentee and in a pair - who is the mentor and who is the mentee. In addition, when creating a new pair, the list will seach over the mentors and over the mentees separately.
<p>
A few times in the past week we have found that the master branch was not working due to migration files being edited. We have found this issue due to Git because when merging files it shows the difference of two files and has some weird text it inputs into some files which "break" our project. These issues are easy to solve but can be frustrating at stages.
  
### TECHNICAL BREADTH OF OUTPUTS
Since our previous Project Concept Audit, we have been trying to complete a wide range of issues which are both located on the front-end and the back-end of our website. Such issues can include editing the size of text or the colour of text to a webpage or creating a new layout for a webpage. Many of the issues regarding the back-end are all to do with Django and updating the way in which the framework works, so that we can get it to work in the way we want. For example, manual pairing is now finished due to admins being able to see which student is paired to which mentor. In addition to this, converting our current SQLite database to a MySQL database was a different task that we had to deal with.
<p>
Since we have made our project open source, it has been very good seeing the amount of people who have been interesed in working on our project, so far 3 have joined. As soon as they joined we needed to explain to them what the project was and what they can work on. This took a while to do as we weren't sure of their technical ability and/or what our team was working on currently. The way we solved this was to give them set tasks which our team wasn't currently working on during the week in which they could work on. The other challenge was that we were dealing with people from half way around the world which made it a bit more strenouous to communicate with. In addition to this, they posted on Slack very often which made it very important to respond to their question asap, so that they could continue their work/progress.

### APPROPRIATENESS OF OUTPUTS
All of these outputs in which we worked towards and delivered in the past few weeks contributed to completing the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1esrEn1yXSeUk0wQW5URUY3b0k/view?usp=sharing">Minimal Viable Product</a> in which our Client can now run a test Mentoring Program within their committee. This has ticked off one of the project requirements stated by the client.

## PROJECT APPROACH
### DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
The development approach being taken by the team has been BAU (Business As Usual). In our team meetings, we work on Github issues and also discuss any problems that we might be having and seek help from our tutor. During the week, we work separately on our issues and report these to the rest of the team at the end of the week. After migrating to Zenhub from Trello, the issues have been more organised since they have a label indicating which aspect of the project they belong to and also a milestone, which indicates the deadline by which they need to be completed. 

Before starting to work on an issue, team members assign themselves to it and move the issue card to the “In Progress” pipeline. Once they finish working on the issue, they test the code out themselves to make sure that everything that was working before the issue works after completing it as well. After pushing their code to the Development branch, they move the issue card to “Review/QA” so that other team members can review their work and once everything is tested, the issue can be closed. All the work is done on the Development branch and once it is reviewed, it is pushed to the master branch. 

Since opening our project to the wider community, we now have a bit more time, which allows us to offer them tasks in which they can work on and we can learn from what they have done. During each team meeting we will now review all pull requests before we move on, so that we can then update our contributors.

### ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Since our last Project Concept Audit, we have met up with our client twice, on the 13th of August and 27th of August, in which the agenda of the meetings can be <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1esrEn1yXSebUE1RmJqVEFLWjQ?usp=sharing">found here</a>. In addition to this, we also have a channel on our Slack Team called #client_communication which can show all the discussions we have had with our client. Last client meeting, we talked to our client and discuss what are plans for the next few weeks are and outlined goals for the rest of the semester which can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1esrEn1yXSeSF93ODJOV2I3bTA .

Since the Week 6 Project Audit, we have met up with our client, Allissa four times. The dates of these meetings and their agendas can be found below. In addition to this, we have also updated our client using the #client_communication channel on Slack and via personal messages. In our most recent client meeting on the 15th of October, we discussed with her exactly what will be happening in the next few weeks, a list of documents that will be produced for the handover, the date of the handover and what course assessment we have got left to finish before the end of the semester. Our client meeting notes can be found in this folder:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1esrEn1yXSeSF93ODJOV2I3bTA

### PROFESSIONAL TEAM ATTITUTDE
As a team we do our best to maintain a professional attitude with our client, tutor and with each other. We have a client meeting at least once a week or once a fortnight in which we update our client on our current progress and our next steps. We keep in contact with our open source contributors at least once every 2-3 days to make sure that we know what they are working on and if they needed any help. All team members have arrived to meetings on time or have given adequate notice if they are unable to attend, in which case, we sometimes call them via Skype. We decide the time for our team meetings via a Doodle Poll or Slack. 

### TEAM COLLABORATION
Our team collaborates via Slack and Github. We mainly communicate via Slack and also update each other about the project progress by posting issues on Github. We have weekly team meetings dedicated to work on the project including both code and course assessment. In addition to this, everyone tries to complete the issues logged on GitHub and has a good track of committing on GitHub.

Since the Week 6 Audit, we have had 9 team meetings, the details of which can be found below:
