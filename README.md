# ONLINE MENTORING PROGRAM PLATFORM
## CLIENT - ANU FIFTY50

Our client ANU Fifty50 is a student-run organisation promoting gender equity in STEM. Their vision is to have an equitable STEM pipeline from university to industry and academia, inclusive of all students, regardless of their gender.

The project is to build an Online Mentoring Platform in the form of a website. The intent is to replace the current Wattle platform used by Fifty50. The platform automates the current mentoring program. Younger students (mentees) are paired with older students (mentors), which leads to the formation of inter-year networks. The program is different from other mentoring programs around as it has targeted content and forces the users to be reflective. Users can signup to the platform anytime. Once there is a match, a mentoring relationship is started. Content is released fortnightly and mentees and mentors can meet each other either in person or online.
